MoneyX - an intentionally vulnerable payment application
===

Quick Start (Cloud9)
----
1. ```gradle build run```
2. Login as user : user123

Setup
----
1. Install Gradle, the package manager, using ```sudo apt-get install gradle``` (Ubuntu/Debian) or ```brew install gradle``` (OSX).
2. Make sure Java8 (listed as version 1.8) is installed and the default Java on your system. Obtaining this will depend on your OS, but generally you can download the Oracle JDK from their [website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
3. Once in the code directly, run ```gradle build``` to assemble the app and pull in dependencies. You can also create a WAR file by running ```gradle war```.
4. Launch the application from the same directory with ```gradle run```

Credentials
----
MoneyX has a few preloaded credentials for use. Others are available as well.
1. user : user123
